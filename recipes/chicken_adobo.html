    <p>
        The unofficial national dish of the Philippines! Adobo refers to a
        cooking style, so this can theoretically be done with any meat but is
        most commonly done with chicken or pork. The meat is simmered in a soy
        and vinegar sauce and is commonly served with white rice.
