        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>10 cups of water</li>
            <li>7 ounces of pearl sago</li>
            <li>7 ounces of palm sugar</li>
            <li>Half cup of water</li>
            <li>2 cups of canned coconut milk</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil 10 cups of water in a large pot. Slowly stir the sago
                pearls in to prevent clumping. Return to a boil then reduce the 
                head to low. Cook until the sago turns translucent while
                occasionally stirring for 30 minutes. Pour the sago into jelly
                molds and refrigerate the molds overnight.
            </li>
            <li>In a small saucepan, stir the palm sugar and water. Bring
                to a boil until the sugar has dissolved. Strain through a fine 
                sieve until sugar has dissolved.
            </li>
            <li>Unmold the refrigerated pudding. Serve with the coconut milk
                and palm sugar syrup separately for each consumer to pour over
                their pudding.
            </li>
        </ol>
